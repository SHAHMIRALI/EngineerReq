# EngineerReq
The app is a client and engineer request app in which clients request repairs from an engineering company. The client enters his/her contact information along with the address and the problem that they are experiencing, which is then sent to an online database. A background task then converts the address to latitude and longitude for precise location. Engineers can then access each request within the app in a list, and are allowed to set a requests status to open, close or in progress. Additionally, when a request is selected, a map with directions to the clients address is displayed along with markers on the locations of other client requests.
